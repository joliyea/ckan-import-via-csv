Importing CKAN Datasets + Resources from a CSV
=========================

What seems like a long overdue tutorial for frustrated dataset maintainers who are nearly in tears that it took months to set up their CKAN and now have only a few days to upload a vast amount of data.
--------------------------------------


This repository contains [iPython Notebook](CKAN_bulk_load_datasets_and_resources_via_csv.ipynb) tutorial uses a [template CSV](datacatalog-example.csv) to add a large number of new Datasets and Resources (links to the data) to a CKAN Data Portal.

Setting up a working CKAN for production-level usage and importing data has been a bit of a waking nightmare, given the fragmented state of CKAN's documentation, so just maybe this will help you out.

# Getting Started
* [Just go to the notebook](CKAN_bulk_load_datasets_and_resources_via_csv.ipynb)

# Notes / warnings:
* This project is not under active development. It is intended to demonstrate how to use the CKAN API to perform this task and hopefully spur the CKAN Project to update their documentation to make this substantially easier for new users to grasp.
